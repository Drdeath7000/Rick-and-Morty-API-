# Rick-and-Morty-API-
Build an app that will use Retrofit to fetch results from an online API of your choice, save it in a local database using Room, and reflect the changes in the database to the UI. The app must contain at least 4 different fragments. Each fragment needs to hold different data received from Retrofit, and different functionalities.
The app also must contain a “favorite” section that will display the user’s favorite items in a RecyclerView. In this section, the users will be able to add, edit and remove items. Each item in the RecyclerView must contain an image.
Using APIs
In this assignment you will interact with an API via requests (probably GET requests only). Some of them require no additional operations, and you simply need to send a request with Retrofit. Others require you to register, and use a token that will be attached to your network requests. A token allows you to identify and authenticate yourself when interacting with the API. 
There is absolutely no need to pay for an API, there are plenty of free APIs. Just pick one, and if you’re having troubles, you can reach me at my email.
