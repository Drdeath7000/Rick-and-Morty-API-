The purpose of this project is to build an app that will use Retrofit to fetch results from an online API of your choice, save it in a local database using Room, and reflect the changes in the database to the UI. The app contains 4 different fragments. Each fragment holds different data received from Retrofit, and different functionalities.
The app also contains a “favorite” section that will display the user’s favorite items in a RecyclerView. In this section, the users will be able to add, edit and remove items. Each item in the RecyclerView must contain an image.
